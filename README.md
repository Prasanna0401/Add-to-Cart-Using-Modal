# React Shopping Cart with Modal Interface

This is a simple React application that fetches product data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) and allows users to add products to their shopping cart through a modal interface. It demonstrates how to manage state in React, work with APIs, and create a modal interface for a shopping cart.

- **Fetch Products**: Fetch product data from the Fake Store API and display it in a list.
- **Add to Cart**: Allows users to add products to the cart.
